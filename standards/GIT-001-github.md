## 1. Commit Format

### 1.1 Conventional Commits (Required)

All commit messages MUST follow [Conventional Commits v1.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### 1.2 Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat(button): add size="lg" variant` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(tabs): correct aria-selected on rerender` |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change | `refactor(tokens): move contrast utils to separate file` |
| `docs` | Documentation only | `docs(standards): add WCAG 2.1 AA compliance` |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, no logic change | `style(card): fix indentation` |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests | `test(button): add keyboard navigation tests` |
| `chore` | Build, tooling, CI, dependencies | `chore(deps): update react to 19.1` |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | `perf(grid): memoize layout calculations` |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration | `ci: add accessibility audit step` |
| `build` | Build system changes | `build(tsup): add minification` |

### 1.3 Scopes

Scope = layer or package affected:

```text
tokens, ui, sections, features, hooks, providers, cli, eslint-plugin,
browser, create-app, theme, layout, a11y, docs, standards
```

### 1.4 Rules

- Description in **imperative mood**: "add feature" NOT "added feature"
- Description in **English** always (per Language Rule)
- No period at end
- Lowercase first letter
- Max 72 characters in first line
- Body: explain WHY, not WHAT (diff shows WHAT)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Good
feat(sections): add hero-section with 3 variants
fix(theme): correct contrast ratio for muted-foreground on Zinc
refactor(docs): consolidate standards into docs/standards/

# Bad
update stuff
fixed bug
Added new component
feat: add feature.  # no period
feat(ui): This component does X and Y and Z...  # too long
```

---

## 2. Branch Naming

### 2.1 Format

```text
<type>/<ticket>-<short-description>
```

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `feat/` | New feature | `feat/wcag-contrast-audit` |
| `fix/` | Bug fix | `fix/tabs-keyboard-nav` |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring | `refactor/docs-consolidation` |
| `docs/` | Documentation | `docs/github-standard` |
| `chore/` | Tooling, CI | `chore/update-deps` |
| `release/` | Release preparation | `release/v1.2.0` |

### 2.2 Rules

- Lowercase, hyphens only (no underscores, no camelCase)
- Max 50 characters
- Short description: 2-4 words
- No ticket number = use descriptive name

---

## 3. Forbidden Operations

### 3.1 CRITICAL: Never Do This

| Operation | Why Forbidden | Alternative |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `git pull --rebase` | Blocks Z.ai sandbox on conflict | `git push --force-with-lease` |
| `git push --force` | Overwrites remote without safety | `git push --force-with-lease` |
| `git pull` after remote URL change | Creates unnecessary conflicts | `git push --force-with-lease` |
| `git reset --hard` without backup | Data loss | Backup first (see Section 4) |
| Direct push to `main` for experiments | No review, no rollback | Use branch + PR/merge |
| Commit secrets/tokens | Security breach | Use `.env.example` + `.gitignore` |
| `git add .` for partial changes | Stages unrelated files | `git add -p` or explicit paths |
| Amend published commits | Rewrites shared history | New commit instead |

### 3.2 WARNING: Avoid Without Good Reason

| Operation | Risk | When OK |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `git merge` (vs rebase) | Messy history | Release branches only |
| `git rebase -i` on shared branch | Rewrites others' commits | Only on your own branch |
| `git cherry-pick` | Duplicate commits | Hotfixes only |
| Force push to feature branch | Team disruption | Solo work only |

---

## 4. Backup Before Rewrite

Before ANY operation that rewrites history (rebase, merge, pull, reset --hard):

```bash
# Step 1: Stash uncommitted work
git stash push -m "pre-op-backup"

# Step 2: Copy packages (most valuable code)
cp -r packages/ /tmp/stsgs-backup/

# Step 3: Save git log reference
git log --oneline -20 > /tmp/git-log-backup.txt
```

### 4.1 Recovery from Git Lockup

If a previous session left git in blocked state:

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Backup first per Section 4 (stash + copy + log)
rm -rf .git/rebase-merge .git/rebase-apply
git reset --hard HEAD
```

**Note:** `git reset --hard` in this section is an EMERGENCY recovery from a deadlocked state (rebase/merge stuck, all tools blocked). This is the ONLY exception to the §3.1 prohibition, because in a deadlock state there is no working data to lose — the repository is already unusable. In all other cases, §3.1 applies: backup first.

### 4.2 No Panic Diagnostics

Before telling user data is lost, check ALL 5 paths:

1. `ls packages/ui/src/` — do files exist?
2. `ls .git/rebase-merge/` — is rebase paused?
3. `git reflog` — are commits referenced?
4. `ls /tmp/stsgs-backup-*/` — were backups created?
5. `git fsck --lost-found` — dangling objects?

NEVER say "permanently lost" until all 5 checks are exhausted.

---

## 5. Push Policy

### 5.1 Push Frequency

Push after every significant change. Do not accumulate half-finished work locally.

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Feature or fix completed | Push immediately |
| End of work session | Push even if unfinished |
| CI red | Push OK, fix soon |
| Experimental branch | Push immediately, do not merge without review |
| Token expired | Update token, update remote URL, push |

**Minimum:** 1 push at end of every session.

**Formula:**

```text
work -> commit -> push -> peace of mind
```

### 5.2 Checkpoint System

Do NOT wait until session end. Create checkpoints during work systematically.

| Checkpoint Type | When | Commit Format |
|-----------------|------|---------------|
| **WIP** | Every 15-20 min during active work | `chore(wip): checkpoint -- <task-id> in progress` |
| **Milestone** | Logical unit completed | `feat(ui): add button component` |
| **Pre-risk** | Before risky operation (refactor, delete) | `chore: checkpoint before <operation>` |
| **Session End** | End of session | `chore: session checkpoint` |

**WIP Checkpoint Rules:**

- Even incomplete work gets committed
- Prefix with `chore(wip):` to signal "work in progress"
- Push immediately after commit
- Log to worklog.md

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# After 15-20 min of work
git add -A
git commit -m "chore(wip): checkpoint -- task 2-a in progress"
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# Continue working...
```

### 5.3 Recovery Tags

Before operations that might need rollback:

```bash
# Create recovery point
git tag checkpoint-<task-id>-before-<operation>
git push origin checkpoint-<task-id>-before-<operation>

# Example
git tag checkpoint-2a-before-refactor
git push origin checkpoint-2a-before-refactor

# Perform risky operation...

# If something goes wrong, rollback
git reset --hard checkpoint-2a-before-refactor
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

**Tag naming convention:**

```text
checkpoint-<task-id>-before-<operation>
checkpoint-<task-id>-after-<operation>  (optional, for verification)
```

### 5.4 Force Push Rules

| Command | Status | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `git push --force-with-lease origin main` | CORRECT | Safe force push with remote check |
| `git push --force origin main` | AVOID | No safety check, overwrites silently |
| `git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>` | OK | Feature branch force push after rebase |

---

## 6. Versioning and Tags

### 6.1 Semantic Versioning

All releases MUST follow [SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/):

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

| Change | Bump | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Breaking API change | MAJOR | 1.x.x -> 2.0.0 |
| New feature (backward compatible) | MINOR | 1.2.x -> 1.3.0 |
| Bug fix (backward compatible) | PATCH | 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4 |

### 6.2 Tagging

```bash
# Annotated tag (required)
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "feat: add hero-section with 3 variants"

# Push tag
git push origin v1.2.0
```

Rules:
- Tags MUST be annotated (`-a`), not lightweight
- Tag format: `v` + semver (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
- No pre-release tags without team agreement

### 6.3 Changelog

Every release MUST update `CHANGELOG.md` with:

```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- hero-section with 3 variants

### Fixed
- Contrast ratio for muted-foreground on Zinc theme

### Changed
- Consolidated docs into docs/ directory
```

---

## 7. Branch Protection

### 7.1 Main Branch

- No direct pushes (use PR or merge from feature branch)
- CI must pass before merge
- At least 1 review required (when team grows)
- Squash merge preferred (clean history)

### 7.2 Feature Branches

- Auto-delete after merge
- Prefix with type (feat/, fix/, refactor/)
- One feature per branch — no mixed changes

### 7.3 Release Branches

- `release/vX.Y.Z` for release preparation
- Only bug fixes and docs on release branches
- Merge back to main after release

---

## 8. .gitignore Requirements

These MUST be in `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Secrets
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Build
dist/
.next/
.turbo/

# Database
*.db
*.db-journal

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log
dev.log

# Uploads (user content, not code)
upload/
```

### 8.1 Required in Repository

These MUST be committed:

```text
.env.example        # Safe defaults, no real secrets
.eslintrc.*         # Linting configuration
.prettierrc         # Formatting configuration
```

---

## 9. GitHub-Specific

### 9.1 Repository Settings

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Default branch | `main` | Standard convention |
| Allow force push | Disabled on `main` | Prevent history rewrite |
| Allow deletion | Disabled on `main` | Prevent accidental removal |
| Issues | Enabled | Track bugs and features |
| Wiki | Disabled | Use docs/ instead |
| Discussions | Enabled | Community questions |

### 9.2 Issue Labels

| Label | Color | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `bug` | Red | Something broken |
| `feature` | Green | New functionality |
| `a11y` | Blue | Accessibility |
| `breaking` | Orange | Breaking change |
| `docs` | Gray | Documentation |
| `good first issue` | Light green | Onboarding |
| `wontfix` | Dark gray | Not fixing |

### 9.3 PR Checklist

Every PR MUST pass this checklist:

- [ ] Conventional commit format
- [ ] No secrets in diff
- [ ] CI passes
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated (for user-facing changes)
- [ ] Docs updated (if behavior changed)
- [ ] WCAG checklist passed (if UI changed)
- [ ] No new `any` types
- [ ] Barrel exports updated (if new module)

---

## 10. Log Everything

After every git operation, log to `worklog.md`:

```markdown
### Git Operation: <operation>
- **Before**: <hash>
- **After**: <hash>
- **Result**: success / failed / conflicted
- **Details**: <what happened>
```

## 12A. Known Issues and Proposed Solutions

This section documents discovered inconsistencies, missing content, and proposed corrections. Each issue has an ID, status, and proposed action. Issues resolved in the current version are marked `[RESOLVED]`; outstanding issues are marked `[OPEN]`.

### GIT-001 `[RESOLVED in v2.1]` — StackSignature cited Git concepts instead of project stack

**Problem:** Prior to v2.1, the footer read "Built with: Git + Conventional Commits + SemVer 2.0 + GitHub". Per STD-DOC-002 §8 (Stack Signature), the format is `Built with: <project technologies>`, where the technologies are the project's tech stack (e.g., "Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS"). Git, Conventional Commits, SemVer, and GitHub are tools/specifications used by this standard — they describe what the standard *governs*, not what the project is *built with*. Every other standard in the project uses the conventional Next.js stack signature.

**Resolution:** Footer updated to "Built with: Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS". The Git/Conventional Commits/SemVer/GitHub conventions are already implicit in the standard's title and body — they do not need to be repeated in the stack signature. The same fix was applied to STD-GIT-002 (see GSB-001 in that file's Known Issues).

### GIT-002 `[OPEN]` — §5.3 "Recovery Tags" uses `git reset --hard` to roll back, contradicting §3.1 prohibition

**Problem:** §5.3 (Recovery Tags) shows:

```bash
git reset --hard checkpoint-2a-before-refactor
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

However, §3.1 (CRITICAL: Never Do This) lists `git reset --hard` without backup as a forbidden operation. The §5.3 example does not explicitly state that the checkpoint tag itself serves as the backup, which could be misread as a violation of §3.1. The §4.1 "Recovery from Git Lockup" section explicitly notes that `git reset --hard` in deadlock recovery is the only exception to §3.1 — §5.3 has no such note.

**Proposed solution:** Add a note to §5.3: "The `git reset --hard checkpoint-<task-id>-before-<operation>` command is safe because the checkpoint tag preserves the pre-operation state — the tag IS the backup required by §3.1. This is not an exception to §3.1; it is §3.1's backup-first rule applied via tags. Always verify the tag exists (`git tag -l checkpoint-*`) before running the reset."

### GIT-003 `[OPEN]` — §8 .gitignore requires `upload/` but does not mention `Z-ai-standards/`

**Problem:** §8 (.gitignore Requirements) lists `upload/` under "Uploads (user content, not code)". The project also has a `Z-ai-standards/` directory containing the standards set — these are governance documents, not project source code. Whether `Z-ai-standards/` should be committed or gitignored is not specified. If committed, the repository bloats with standards that may diverge from the canonical source. If gitignored, new contributors cannot find the standards.

**Proposed solution:** Add a §8.2 "Project Documentation Directories" subsection: "The `Z-ai-standards/` directory contains the project's governance standards. It SHOULD be committed to the repository so contributors can read the rules, but SHOULD NOT be modified per-project — updates come from the canonical standards source. Add a `.gitattributes` entry: `Z-ai-standards/** linguist-vendored` to exclude standards files from language statistics." Alternatively, document the chosen policy (committed vs gitignored) explicitly.
